**MATPLAN** stands for **MAT**lab and probability-based **PLAN**ning tool that is developed for resource adequacy evaluation and production costing. As an open-source open-architecture software tool, MATPLAN was engineered to provide lightweight and flexible modules to deal with generation expansion planning (GEP) problems with consideration of renewable energy sources. MATPLAN offered: scalability, modularization, flexibility, interoperability, open-source access and cost-effectiveness, as well as parallel computing capability, allowing it to work with MATLAB parallel computing toolbox for improving the computational efficiency.
